# gcp-cloudbuild-gae-flex-angular
A sample Angular project to be deployed to Google Cloud App Engine Flexible Environment using Cloud Build.

## Deploy from your machine with a few commands

- Clone/fork the repository.
- Edit `cloudbuild.yaml` and remove the `--version=$SHORT_SHA` option. It will work only for Cloud Build triggered builds.
- Then:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml .
```

## Understand the concepts and design a fully automated build workflow

## Main differences from the App Engine Standard Environment setup (presented in above article)

1. The `app.yaml` file cannot be stored in the root folder due to an App Engine Flexible Environment requirement, so I created a `gae-flex` folder to store it.
1. Since the `gae-flex` folder was created, I decided to put all flex environment stuff there.
1. The `main.py` and `requirements.txt` files are required to setup a basic web server (Flask is not the best option to serve static content, but helps to let things clear and running in this tutorial).
1. All files generated by `npm build...` command are copied to `gae-flex/static` before deploying the application to App Engine. Please refer to `cloudbuild.yaml` for details.
